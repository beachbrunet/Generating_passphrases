// Assignment Code
// Great the user and inform them of the 8-128 charectors that will be used.
// Then ask the user how many charectors they would like to be used(prompt)
// Record the input and approve it for the rules stated above. (if else) (8-128)
// Ask user the following: Do you want to use special charectors? Lowercase? Uppercase? Numbers?
// Record the user inputs for all questions for the generator.
// 


// This is the start of the code, letting the user know we are gonna get started with asking the required Q's
